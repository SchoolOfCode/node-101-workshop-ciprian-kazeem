// If there's only one of the item in your collection, it should log "I have a `name`. Here's what I like about it: `whatILike`". If you have more than one of it, the message should log "I have `count` `name`s. Here's what I like about them: `whatILike`".

// For example, the result of calling the `describeItem` function with the first item in our collection would be:
// _"I have a School of Code mug. Here's what I like about it: It has my cute pixel character on it!"_

// Call your function below where you've defined it, handing in the first item in `myCollection`.

// Now run the file again (using `node index.js`);
